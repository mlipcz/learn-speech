Generate pair of audio sentences in 2 languages to repeat and learn when driving or jogging

I was inspired by language learning series in Polish by Beata Pawlikowska - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9gnTCm3Hfo - "Blondynka na jÄ™zykach".
There are series of pairs of sentences in your native language and the language which you're learning, separated by a pause.
You hear a sentence, try to translate it to another language and speak, then you compare the result with what you hear.

The audio series are recorder by professional lectors, but why not to use Amazon's services: Polly and Translate?

Prequisites:
AWS account with credentials in your user directory or in system settings.
